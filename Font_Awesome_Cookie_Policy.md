## Introduction

A cookie policy helps users identity what information we collect in cookie form while also providing guidance on how and 
when it is acceptable for developers to add or modify cookies plus any specific steps required before rolling out cookie
changes.

### Goal Statement

The cookie policy should specify how we address cookie related issues specifically. All technical aspects should be governed
by other the appropriate policies such as the privacy policy or change management policy (as it may apply practically). This
policy should also clearly layout what cookies we use and why.

### Background Statement 

We, at Fonticons, Inc., know our culture and general attitude toward privacy concerns, etc. It is entirely reasonable for 
others planning to use our technology to desire to understand our goals and commitments around security and privacy. Cookie
