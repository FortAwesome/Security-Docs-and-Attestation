## Introduction

An incident response policy clearly defines the roles, responsibilities, and expectations around investigations and actions
associated with a cybersecurity incident, such as a data breach or other attack.

### Goal Statement

As regards cybersecurity incidents, our focus is on restoring functionality while doing whatever is practical to maintain
any available information about the attack. However, given the generally very low risk nature of our solution, we will
typically prioritize restoring functionality and maintaining client commitments first.

We, at Fonticons Inc., know our culture but it is entirely reasonable for others planning to use our technology to desire to
understand how we deal with issues, especially those that might result in a loss of or degradation of service.
