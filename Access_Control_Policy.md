## Introduction

An access control policy helps employees and external parties understand who is allowed to access what client and user data
and under what circumstances and conditions they can access that data.

### Goal Statement

At present, we are a small company (literally everyone in the company knows everyone else on a first name basis). The
unfortunate reality is that, no matter how much we may know, like, or trust an individual we know personally, they have the
capacity to take harmful actions. Beyond that, there is risk that an employee's identity (from a system perspective) may be
compromised allowing an attacker the same level of access as an employee. In general, we mitigate these kinds of risks by
collecting as little data as possible so that, even in the event of a breach, nothing of value would be lost. However, we do
offer a service whose value is in its availability and providing too much access to everyone could result in a loss of that
availability to our clients. To that end we need some basic guidelines indicating who should have access to what, and how,
when, and why that access should change.

### Background Statement 

We, at Fonticons, Inc., know our culture but it is entirely reasonable for others planning to use our technology to desire
to understand our goals and commitments around security and privacy. Some of our policies have been de facto in nature, e.g.,
you simply can't get access to something because so-and-so wouldn't give it to you. While this is arguably effective for a 
company of our size, having a de jure policy that others can consider is appropriate for the space in which we work.
