## Introduction

A privacy policy helps users understand what information we collect, why we collect it, what we do with it, and how they can 
request changes or removal of their data.

### Goal Statement

It has always been a part of the culture at Fonticons that we want to do the right thing for both us and our clients. Our 
goal is to respect everyone's privacy within reasonable boundaries allowed by the technology and commenserate with what we 
believe is the low risk nature of our solution. This means we will consider privacy at every point but may choose not to 
take special or extraordinary action to address concerns that are common to using a public network like the Internet. For 
example, to serve an icon, we need an IP address so we can send the icon there. We won't make a special attempt to hide that 
data or scrub it from troubleshooting logs. However, by the same token, we won't actively or passively attempt to determine 
things about the user (beyond things like the icons they use and how much bandwidth is requires), nor will we share the 
information we do have with 3rd parties.

### Background Statement 

We, at Fonticons, know our culture but it is entirely reasonable for others planning to use our technology to desire to 
understand our goals and commitments around security and privacy. While we aren't hiding this information (anyone could 
reach out via help@fontawesome.com any time and get this information), it is valuable to make it clear and publicly 
available. Additionally, data protection laws are in force in almost all countries and the basic principle underlying these 
laws is the requirement of informed consent for processing by the data subject, providing the subject (at least in 
principle) with control over potential negative effects.

## Definitions 

__Privacy__ 
This is surprisingly complex and any definition made here is subject to change, especially as laws and mores change over 
time. However, in general we think of privacy as:
A non-absolute right of persons to have direct or indirect control over access to: 
1. Information about the person (referred to as personal information/data)
1. Situations in which others could acquire personal information/data, and 
1. Technology that can be used to generate, process or disseminate personal information/data

We say this right is non-absolute because you cannot walk in a public place (for example) and demand no one notice anything
about you. It is important to remember that, in a general sense, the Internet is, effectively, a public place, though it may
be accessed from a private location.

__Personal Information/Data__
Personal information/data is defined in the law as information/data that can be linked with a natural person. This can be anything from a name to 
relgious affiliation, to sexual preference, to IP address.
