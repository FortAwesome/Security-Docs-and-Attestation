## Introduction

This policy helps clients and employees understand under what conditions we delete a user account.

### Goal Statement

The purpose of this policy is to clarify how we honor account deletion requests in general and specifically as to comply
with various aspects of GDPR.

### Background Statement 

Our account deletion process is both immediate and permanent. While unintentional or inappropriate deletion of a free 
account is inconvenient, deletion of a paid account may include monetary and data loss. Despite conspicuous warnings, some
users have misunderstood the nature of account deletion. To that end, we require paid accounts to make their request via 
email and confirm that they understand that the service will end immediately and all data, not backed up in another location
will be lost. Unfortunately, this approach creates a security risk. As email is considered insufficient to establish
identity we require the user to take an authenticated action to request account deletion.
