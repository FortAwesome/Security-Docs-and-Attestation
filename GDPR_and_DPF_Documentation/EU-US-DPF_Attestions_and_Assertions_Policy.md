# EU-US-DPF ATTESTATIONS & ASSERTIONS POLICY (DRAFT)

## Classification Level

Publicly Available

## Review Information

__Mandatory Review Period__

Yearly

__Date of Last Review__

October 1, 2024

## Introduction

This is binding guidance that codifies how security and management will validate the attestations and assertions required as part of our compliance plan for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (EU-US-DPF).

### Goal Statement

Given our current size, it is not practical to create automated processes to validate the actions we have taken as part of the EU-US-DPF.  Our best option, in this case, is to undertake periodic reviews and audits that we can make available to required authorities as necessary.

## Definitions 

__Personal Data__ 

Personal data are any information which are related to an identified or identifiable natural person.  This is usually broadly interpreted under EU law.

__Any Information__

Very literally any information.  GDPR uses specific examples but have given themselves leeway to interpret information that an engineer might likely associate with a device or non-living entity (such as a corporation) as being associated with a person.

__Identified or Identifiable Natural Person__

An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

__Broad Interpretation__

Broad interpretation refers to the way in which a document or law is understood and applied. It means that the interpretation is not limited to the literal words used, but takes into account the purpose and intention behind them.
