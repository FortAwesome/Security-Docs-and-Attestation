## Introduction

This is binding guidance that codifies expectations around employee access, usage, and collection of personal data from Fonticons, Inc., users.  Specifically, this policy is part of our compliance plan for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (EU-US-DPF).

### Goal Statement

The goal of this policy is to meaningfully codify General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) based privacy principles into the way work.  Additionally we want to clarify a set of guiding principles we will generally use around data use and collection as regards identified or identifiable natural persons.  Understanding the nuance or fine detail of GDPR is not an expectation but employees must understand a few key concepts and principles.  Acting with these key principles in mind will always be acceptable.

### Background Statement 

Because we allow EU, UK, and Swiss citizens to use our software, we need to make efforts to comply with GDPR.  In general, our practices have historically aligned with GDPR principles, such as collecting minimal amounts of user data and using the data only for the purpose in which it was collected.  There are, however, a number of specific “letter of the law” requirements we must meet.  We have chosen to pursue the EU-US-DPF as a means of meeting those obligations.  

## Definitions 

__Personal Data__ 

Personal data are any information which are related to an identified or identifiable natural person.  This is usually broadly interpreted under EU law.

__Any Information__

Very literally any information.  GDPR uses specific examples but have given themselves leeway to interpret information that an engineer might likely associate with a device or non-living entity (such as a corporation) as being associated with a person.

__Identified or Identifiable Natural Person__

An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

__Broad Interpretation__

Broad interpretation refers to the way in which a document or law is understood and applied. It means that the interpretation is not limited to the literal words used, but takes into account the purpose and intention behind them.

### Examples and Further Explanation

1. An engineer might consider an IP or MAC address as being data about a device.  Under GDPR, if the IP or MAC address is associated with a device owned by a single individual, that data would likely be considered personal data.  If the IP or MAC address is associated with a shared device, that data would likely not be considered personal data unless we also had a timestamp associated with the usage of that device.  In that case it may be considered personal data.  Because we can’t necessarily determine those facts at the moment of collection, it is better to err on the side of assuming the data is personal data.
1. We allow users to optionally choose their favorite icon.  In a very general sense, if someone had access to that data only, they would not be able to identify a natural person.  However, if the user’s icon choice was sufficiently unique and/or conspicuous it might be sufficient to narrow a candidate pool enough to identify a natural person.  Again, because we don’t know what facts will be considered in a legal proceeding, it is best to err on the side of caution and assume that this kind of data is also personal data.
1. Our affiliates are generally corporations.  As such, they aren’t natural persons.  While we still want to protect data about them, that data is generally not protected by GDPR.

## Policy 

1. For every piece of data we collect we must:
   1. Determine if the data could individually or in aggregate, be considered personal data.
   1. Document both internally and externally the reason for collecting the data along with the retention period.
      1. Review EU-US-DPF INTERNAL DATA AUDIT PROCEDURE (internal policy) to determine the appropriate locations for documentation
      1. Internal documentation will be added in the form of developer docs in the associated code so it is visible at development time.
      1. External documentation will be the privacy policy and any associated documents
   1. Take steps to make sure we only use the data for the explicitly stated purpose it was collected.
   1. Take steps to ensure data is not maintained beyond its usage period.
   1. If the data is transferred to a 3rd party, validate and document an existing agreement between us and that party indicating that the data will not be used for any other purpose.
   1. If the data being collected has never been collected before, directly notify users of the change.
   1. Before collecting the data, clearly and conspicuously, give users an option to opt out of the collection if it isn’t specifically necessary.
   1. Document internally what steps are taken to secure the data from unauthorized disclosure.
   1. Document internally what steps are taken to ensure the data is not modified without the consent of the user.
   1. Make the newly collected data available via the data download feature.
1. If new data is collected, the above steps must be validated with their engineering manager or the head of security.
1. To facilitate the accurate collection of data, all 3rd parties or vendors, must be represented in a shared password vault for auditing purposes.
