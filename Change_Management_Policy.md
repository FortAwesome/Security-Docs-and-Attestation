## Introduction

A change management policy helps employees and external parties understand the processes by which we change our software and 
systems. Specifically it helps us and them reason about when, how, and why things might change that may have an impact on 
functionality.

### Goal Statement

At present, we are a small company (literally everyone in the company knows everyone else on a first name basis). Any change 
is easily vetted with all internal stakeholders and subject matter experts. However, it is easy, especially within a group 
that is very comfortable with one another, to grow complacent in our rigor around validating the impact of a change. To that 
end there is some benefit in formalizing aspects of change management or, at minimum, capturing what commonly occurs. When 
contemplating or initiaing change we should always apply due diligence in the consideration of client needs while balancing
our needs as well.

### Background Statement 

We, at Fonticons, know our culture but it is entirely reasonable for others planning to use our technology to desire to 
understand how and why are software and services might change. This is especially true as some of our changes may not be 
backward compatible or may have unforseen impacts (since our software is opensource and thus can and is often leveraged in 
ways that we do not expect).
